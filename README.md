# Machine Learning Portfolio

Hi everyone,
These are some of the projects that I did for academic, study, and hobby purposes.

## Glass Classification

The first one is a classical problem of classification of unbalanced classes.
Here, I used the glass dataset [Available at the UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/42/glass+identification).

In this problem, I started with some techniques of exploratory data analysis. The purpose was to check the data distribution and statistics. Check duplicates or null values.
I also plotted some graphs for better visualization (pair plot, violin graph, correlation) [you can see here the EDA](https://github.com/MartFrancisco/Machine_Learning_Portifolio/blob/Glass-Classification-Project/exploratory%20data%20analysis.ipynb)

Five models were generated and then evaluated and tuned. Four performance indicators were computed for each model, before and after tunning (F1, recall, accuracy, and precision).
